## Architecture

This repository involves a `Factory` smart-contract which can create new `Anchoring` smart-contracts on-demand. The Anchoring contract provides a callable function (`anchor`) to anchor a message. This function can only be called by users that have been whitelisted on the Anchoring contract. The administrator role of the Anchoring contract can `authorize` or `unauthorize` some users.

This function can only be called by the administrator role of the Factory.



These two contracts also provides "getter" function that retrieves specific information from the storage (more details in the following sections).


### Factory Contract  

The Factory contract is responsible for deploying an Anchoring contract for each client/product.

The creation of an instance of Factory contract (i.e. deployment of a Factory contract) requires two parameters:
- the admin address
- the anchoring contract class hash.

#### Features:
- Administration: The Factory contract contains an admin. Only this admin can use the deployment function of the Anchoring contract.
- Admin Transfer proposal: The admin of the Factory contract can designate another address as a proposed admin.
- Admin change confirmation: The proposed admin of the factory can invoke the `acceptAdmin` entrypoint to become the new admin role, and thereby forfeit the old admin access.

- Deployment: When the admin calls the `deploy` function, it creates a new instance of Anchoring contract. The administrator address of the Anchoring contract must be provided as parameter. Note that the given admin address is also whitelisted at Anchoring contract level.
- Admin Class hash modification: The admin of the Factory contract can specify another Anchoring contract class hash.
- Once an anchoring contract is generated, its owner can be queried (with `get_anchor_contract_owner` entrypoint). 

- The smart contract also provides a reverse map that allow anyone to query the anchoring contracts generated by a specific user address. `get_owner_contract_by_owner_index` entrypoint returns an contract address (for a given user address and an index). For example , `get_owner_contract_by_owner_index(<user_address>, 0)` retrieves the first contract generated by the given `<user_address>`.

- The `get_owner_contract_index` provides the number of contracts generated by a `<user_address>`. For example, the following invocation retrieves the last contract generated by the given user_address: `get_owner_contract_by_index(<user_address>, get_owner_contract_index(<user_address>) - 1)`.



### Anchoring Contract:  

The Anchoring contract is responsible for anchoring a hash (SHA-256). 

#### Features:
- Administration: The Anchoring contract contains an admin role. Only this admin can add/remove a user from the whitelist with `authorize` and `unauthorize` functions .
- Whitelisting: Only the whitelisted address can anchor a message. 

- Anchoring messages: Whitelisted users can anchor a message by calling the `anchor` function (and by specifying a message as parameter).
- Message uniqueness: A message can only be anchored once.
- Timestamping: When a message is anchored, the current block's timestamp is saved and associated to. Notice that this feature is redundant with the timestamp of the transaction.

- Anchor verification: anyone can retrieve anchored messages and their related timestamps without any cost.

- Retrieval: One can retrieve an array of all anchored messages with the `get_anchored_values` function, an array of each of message timestamps with `get_anchored_timestamps` function. Additionally, one can retrieve the timestamp for a specific message that has been anchored with `get_anchored_timestamp` function.



## Usage

### Setup

- setup your env variables `make setup`. This step needs to be done only once.
- download npm dependencies `make install`. It installs the "node_module" libraries. The "node_modules" directory can be deleted with the `make clean` command.




### Compilation and tests of smart contracts

- Compilation of smart contracts can be launched with command `make compile`. It produces the sierra code (JSON) and the casm code (JSON) in the `target/dev` directory.
Actually the compile command relies on the scarb package manager and in fact calls the `scarb build` command.

- Tests of smart contracts can be launched with command `make test`. It executes all tests
It also relies on he scarb package manager and in fact calls the `scrab test` command. Tests are based on a test framework  Starknet-foundry, so tests can also be launched with command `snforge`.

If you get the following error,  
```
error: Plugin diagnostic: The 'contract' attribute was deprecated, please use `starknet::contract` instead.
 --> lib.cairo:1:1
#[contract]
^*********^
```
you need to remove node_modules with `make clean` because a module contains a deprecated smart contract example. 

This bug Starknet-foundry will be fixed soon. When it is fixed, you must change the dependency in the `Scarb.toml` file.


### Deployment

The repository provides `scripts` directory containing scripts written in TypeScript for deploying smart contracts and interacting with deployed contracts. 

- It relies on the Starknet-js library which can be installed with `make install`.

- Before deploying an instance of a Factory contract , one must declare (only once) the class contract of Anchoring and Factory.
`make declare-anchoring`
It should produce locally a file `deployments/anchoring_class_hash.ts` with the address of the anchoring class hash.
`make declare-factory`
It should produce locally a file `deployments/factory_class_hash.ts` with the address of the factory class hash.


- Once class contract have been declared, an instance can be produced by deploying the factory contract.
`make deploy-factory`
It should produce locally a file `deployments/factory.ts` with the address of the factory smart contract.

- Once the Factory contract has been deployed, the instance is available for producing a new Anchoring contract.
`make generate-anchoring`
It should produce locally a file `deployments/anchoring.ts` with the address of the anchoring smart contract.

### Anchor a hash !
- Anchor a message. The message is a SHA-256 hash (without the '0x' prefix)
`make anchor-message MSG=1c4c85d3c9855a6f87551d7672b5459d8de5844e20c7cdd8526f78885e31eed9`
- you can also specify the Anchoring contract address as a CLI variable
```
make anchor-message MSG=1c4c85d3c9855a6f87551d7672b5459d8de5844e20c7cdd8526f78885e31eed9 ANCHORING=0x240621f865df3ca79dc1a614d60f06310e19d8c6ac49d337dec6e0246473d2b
```
As you can see the message is specified as a 256-bit hash. Behind the `make anchor-message` command there is a script that splits the given hash into 2 felts before calling the `anchor` entrypoint of the Anchoring contract.



    
## How to interact with the deployed contract on `starkscan` explorer
- First of all, go the [contract page into the explorer, into the tab **Read/Write**](https://testnet.starkscan.co/contract/0x44f99149391e619aaaf55c31fbb9fca8cf4ba542ff961a4999305c3e790e17f#read-write-contract), then you should be able to consult the current anchored value by calling `get_anchored_values()` function.
- For the next interactions, you will need to get a wallet that will make you able to interact with functions on the explorer like [ArgentX](https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/). 
- You will need to create a wallet and fund it with something like `0.001eth` to be fine.
- You can now prepare your message, it can be a number or a string, if you want to do a string you can use a tool like [this](https://string-functions.com/string-hex.aspx) in order to generate an hex version of your string.
-  Call the function `anchor(value)` with value something like `0x<your_hex_converted_value>`.
- Congratulation!
